So, no one can find them! You're hidden. I call that the invisible Web\u0026#x201D;.\n\u0026#xF0A7; Another early use of the term Invisible Web was by Bruce Mount and Matthew B. Koll of Personal\nLibrary Software in 1996.\n\u0026#xF0A7; The first use of the specific term Deep Web, now generally accepted, occurred in the\naforementioned 2001 Bergman study.\n ","How search engines work\n\u0026#xF075; Search engines construct a database of the Web by using programs called spiders or Web crawlers\nthat begin with a list of known Web pages.\n\u0026#xF075; The spider gets a copy of each page and indexes it, storing useful information that will let the page\nbe quickly retrieved again later.\n\u0026#xF075; Any hyperlinks to new pages are added to the list of pages to be crawled.\n\u0026#xF075; Eventually all reachable pages are indexed, unless the spider runs out of time or disk space.\n\u0026#xF075; The collection of reachable pages defines the Surface Web.\n ","How search engines work\n ","Contents\n\u0026#xF075; Dynamic Content\n\u0026#xF075; Unlinked content\n\u0026#xF075; Private Web\n\u0026#xF075; Contextual Web\n\u0026#xF075; Limited access content\n\u0026#xF075; Non-Scripted content\n\u0026#xF075; Non-HTML/text content;\n ","","\u0026#xF075; Dynamic content\n\u0026#x2022; Dynamic pages which are returned in response to a submitted query or accessed only\nthrough a form\n\u0026#x2022; especially if open-domain input elements (such as text fields) are used\n\u0026#x2022; such fields are hard to navigate without domain knowledge\n\u0026#xF075; Unlinked Content\n\u0026#x2022; Pages which are not linked to by other pages\n\u0026#x2022; Which may prevent web crawling programs from accessing the content\n\u0026#x2022; This content is referred to as pages without backlinks (or inlinks).\n ","\u0026#xF075; Private Web: sites that require registration and login (password-protected resources).\n\u0026#xF075; Contextual Web: pages with content varying for different access contexts (e.g., ranges\nof client IP addresses or previous navigation sequence).\n\u0026#xF075; Limited access content: sites that limit access to their pages in a technical way (e.g.,\nusing the Robots Exclusion Standard, CAPTCHAs, or no-cache Pragma HTTP headers which\nprohibit search engines from browsing them and creating cached copies.\n ","\u0026#xF075; Scripted content\npages that are only accessible through links produced by JavaScript as well as content\ndynamically downloaded from Web servers via Flash or Ajax solutions.\n\u0026#xF075; Non-HTML/text content\ntextual content encoded in multimedia (image or video) files or specific file formats not\nhandled by search engines.\n ","Deep Potential\n\u0026#xF075; The deep Web is an endless repository for a mind-reeling amount of information.\n\u0026#xF075; It's powerful. It unleashes human nature in all its forms, both good and bad.\n\u0026#xF075; There are engineering databases, financial information of all kinds, medical papers, pictures, illustrations ... the list\ngoes on, basically, forever.\n\u0026#xF075; For example, construction engineers could potentially search research papers at multiple universities in order to\nfind the latest and greatest in bridge-building materials.\n\u0026#xF075; Doctors could swiftly locate the latest research on a specific disease.\n\u0026#xF075; The potential is unlimited. The technical challenges are daunting. That's the draw of the deep Web.\n ","Shadow Land\n\u0026#xF075; The deep Web may be a shadow land of untapped potential.\n\u0026#xF075; The bad stuff, as always, gets most of the headlines.\n\u0026#xF075; You can find illegal goods and activities of all kinds through the dark Web.\n\u0026#xF075; That includes illicit drugs, child pornography, stolen credit card numbers, human trafficking, weapons, exotic\nanimals, copyrighted media and anything else you can think of.\n\u0026#xF075; Theoretically, you could even, say, hire a hit man to kill someone you don't like.\n\u0026#xF075; But you won't find this information with a Google search.\n\u0026#xF075; These kinds of Web sites require you to use special software, such as The Onion Router, more commonly known\nas Tor.\n ","The Onion Router (TOR)\n\u0026#xF075; Tor is software that installs into your browser and sets up the specific connections you need to access dark\nWeb sites.\n\u0026#xF075; Critically it is free software for enabling online anonymity and censorship resistance.\n\u0026#xF075; Onion routing refers to the process of removing encryption layers from Internet communications, similar to\npeeling back the layers of an onion.\n\u0026#xF075; Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity, including \"visits to Web sites, online posts, instant\nmessages, and other communication forms\", back to the user.\n\u0026#xF075; It is intended to protect the personal privacy of users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct\nconfidential business by keeping their internet activities from being monitored.\n ","Cont\u0026#x2026;\n\u0026#xF075; Instead of seeing domains that end in .com or .org, these hidden sites end in .onion.\n\u0026#xF075; The most infamous of these onion sites was the now-defunct Silk Road, an online marketplace where\nusers could buy drugs, guns and all sorts of other illegal items.\n\u0026#xF075; The FBI eventually captured Ross Ulbricht, who operated Silk Road, but copycat sites like Black Market\nReloaded are still readily available.\n\u0026#xF075; Tor is the result of research done by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, which created Tor for political\ndissidents and whistleblowers, allowing them to communicate without fear of reprisal.\n\u0026#xF075; Tor was so effective in providing anonymity for these groups that it didn't take long for the criminally-\nminded to start using it as well.\n ","Silk Road Website\nU.S. authorities shut down Silk after the\nalleged owner of the site Ross William Ulbricht\nwas arrested.\n ","Money-related transactions\n\u0026#xF075; You may wonder how any money-related transactions can happen when sellers and buyers can't\nidentify each other.\n\u0026#xF075; That's where Bitcoin comes in.\n\u0026#xF075; Bitcoin, it's basically an encrypted digital currency.\n\u0026#xF075; Like regular cash, Bitcoin is good for transactions of all kinds, and notably, it also allows for\nanonymity; no one can trace a purchase, illegal or otherwise.\n\u0026#xF075; When paired properly with TOR, it's perhaps the closest thing to a foolproof way to buy and sell on\nthe web.\n ","The Brighter Side of Darkness\n\u0026#xF075; The deep Web is home to alternate search engines, e-mail services, file storage, file sharing, social\nmedia, chat sites, news outlets and whistleblowing sites, as well as sites that provide a safer meeting\nground for political dissidents and anyone else who may find themselves on the fringes of society.\n\u0026#xF075; In an age where NSA-type surveillance is omnipresent and privacy seems like a thing of the past, the\ndark Web offers some relief to people who prize their anonymity.\n\u0026#xF075; Bitcoin may not be entirely stable, but it offers privacy, which is something your credit card company\nmost certainly does not.\n\u0026#xF075; For citizens living in countries with violent or oppressive leaders, the dark Web offers a more secure way\nto communicate with like-minded individuals.\n ","Invisible Web Search Tools\n\u0026#x2022;

The lines between search engine content and the deep Web have begun to blur, as search services\nstart to provide access to part or all of once-restricted content.\n\u0026#xF075; An increasing amount of deep Web content is opening up to free search as publishers and libraries\nmake agreements with large search engines.\n\u0026#xF075; In the future, deep Web content may be defined less by opportunity for search than by access fees or\nother types of authentication.\n ","Conclusion\n\u0026#xF075; The deep web will continue to perplex and fascinate everyone who uses the internet.\n\u0026#xF075; It contains an enthralling amount of knowledge that could help us evolve technologically and as a\nspecies when connected to other bits of information.\n\u0026#xF075; And of course, its darker side will always be lurking, too, just as it always does in human nature.\n\u0026#xF075; The deep web speaks to the fathomless, scattered potential of not only the internet, but the human\nrace, too.\n ","References\n\u0026#xF075; http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/how-the-deep-web-\nworks5.htm\n\u0026#xF075;
